## Features
- Displays a profile card with name and roles
- Includes a sticky header with an avatar and **external links**
- External links open in new tabs using **target="_blank"**
- Responsive and visually clean layout using pure CSS
- **Modular React components (Header, MainContent, Footer)**


## How It Works
- On page load, React renders the main <Page /> component into the #root div in index.html
- <Page /> combines three components:
  - <Header /> ‚Äî includes the avatar and navigation links
  - <MainContent /> ‚Äî displays name and role list
  - <Footer /> ‚Äî shows copyright
- vite handles module bundling and live reload during development
- All styling is handled in index.css, including layout, spacing, and colors
- Links in the header are wrapped in <a> tags with rel="noopener noreferrer" for security


## Notes
- The profile includes links to external pages: Michelle's Portfolio, Knowledge Hub, and GitHub.
- avatar.png must be in the project root or adjust the import path as needed.
